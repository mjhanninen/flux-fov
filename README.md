# Flux FOV

*Flux FOV* is is an experimental [field-of-vision][1] algorithm and tool for
roguelike games.  It is based on the idea of modelling the influx and outflux
of rays (of light, eyesight, radiation, etc.) at the level of an individual
grid cell.

As noted above this is **just an experiment**.  While seeming to work way
better than I anticipated it is still inferior to, for example, shadow casting
algorithms.
